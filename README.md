What is mink
====

mink is an open-source first approach on Ink's UI modules.

It strives to leverage the good ideas and latest trends born in the JS community to deliver a fresh, modular, portable and flexible UI framework.

The first release will feature a few ports of Ink modules running the new API, an integration of an Open Source project, the documentation of the API architecture and some build tools.

Where the goodness comes from:
*    [Ink](https://github.com/sapo/Ink)'s CSS and grid
*    [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and [Zepto](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) compatible API
*    [Ender](https://github.com/ender-js/Ender) as a main helper API
*    Data-attributes autoloading
*    [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) inspired architecture
*    [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) wrapped modules
*    [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org) distribution of modules
